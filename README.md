# CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE PREDICTOR
This project is a part of the SEMESTER 6 Group project at [B.M.S College of Engineering](https://bmsce.ac.in/).  

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to build various Machine & Deep Learning Models that will predict C.L.V by learning from the previous data. Furthermore, choosing the most appropriate model based on its accuracy score.
