## Project Objective

* Obtaining Dataset 
* Identify the Problem Type
* Brief analysis on the Models to be used
* Create a High Level Design, Use Case Design, 
* Building a Machine Learning Model That will be able to predict CLV by learning from the previous data.
* Analysing the Accuracy 
* Visualization of the Dataset 
* Data Set Analysis 

We built various Machine & Deep Learning Models that will be able to predict C.L.V by learning from the previous data. And choosing the most appropriate model, based on its accuracy score.
